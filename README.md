# @codecb/ts-utils

ðŸ›  A modern and practical TypeScript type utility library.

This can be seen as a mix of [ts-toolbelt](https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt), [tsafe](https://github.com/garronej/tsafe), [type-fest](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest), [spec.ts](https://github.com/aleclarson/spec.ts), [Type Zoo](https://github.com/pelotom/type-zoo), [ts-essentials](https://github.com/ts-essentials/ts-essentials), [ts-extras](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ts-extras). It also add many more cool helper types and functions.

What makes `@codecb/ts-utils` unique is how it simplifies the definition of some of the type utilities by using latest TypeScript features.

It can be used in production code to help force strict typing or can be used in development for static type testing. In fact, the library uses its own type assertion utilities to test itself.

Look at the [test cases](./test/) to have of taste of what it brings to the table and how it works.
